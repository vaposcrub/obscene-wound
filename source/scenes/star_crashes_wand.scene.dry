It must only be a few seconds, but the silence feels like hours. Like days.

And then the front door's doorknob rattles for a moment. Before you can consider what it is that you wish to do, something in the lock snaps, and the door swings open inwards.

A person. He looks to be around your age, early 20s. He glows a bright, strong, golden light that you take a second to adjust to, and you realise that he's grinning at you. And *floating*.

His smiling face hovers a few inches from your own and, when he blinks, little orange motes of light spark off his lashes.

- @star_intro_wand: "I've found you!"
