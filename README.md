This template is built on [smwhr's dendry starter pack](https://github.com/smwhr/dendry-starter-pack), with the addition of an editable sidebar and stylesheet. Everything else is mostly the same.

One difference is that to change the game's title and author, you'll have to change line 6 of `out/html/index.html` and line 20 of `out/html/game.js`, as well as `source/info.dry`.

To see what the page looks like, see [https://aucchen.github.io/dendry_sidebar_template/](https://aucchen.github.io/dendry_sidebar_template/).

## Editing the sidebar

See `source/scenes/status.scene.dry` Everything in this scene will be displayed in the sidebar, and will be updated on every click.

## Editing the stylesheet and/or adding custom JS

See `out/html/game.css` and `out/html/game.js`.

## Running locally

### Install dependencies
Run `npm install` in the repository folder.

### Build the game
Run `npm run dendry make-html` in the repository folder.
This will build the game and put the result in the out/html folder.

### Run the game locally
